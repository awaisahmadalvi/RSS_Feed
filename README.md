# RSS_Feed

RSS Feed 1.0

	- This script can be used to read RSS NEWS Feeds. 
	- I used it to get National and COVID-19 related news from "The NEWS INTERNATIONAL" TM.
	- NEWS are then displayed on a dot-matrix Display of 3x2 feet module via UART-Serial port.
	- Scrolling Text is used to roll NEWS. 

Bugs:

	- Script stops after some hours, may be its a memory issue.
	
To-Dos:

	- Add some delay in resyncing RSS to reduce network usage.
	- Filter Publish date from RSS and then display.
